# rss-reader
RSS reader plugin for chrome.


# how it will work
- user adds rss sites / urls to url list
- rss-reader checks urls periodically for updates
- rss-reader will show a button in chrome toolbar / extension bar with the sum of the number of unread feeds of all sites / urls in list
- clicking at rss-reader button will open an list with all sites / urls and the individual value of unread feed for each one
- clicking at url / site in list loads last feeds titles from that url / site; unread feeds come marked
- clicking at a feed title opens a new browser tab / window and loads the feed link, marking it as read
